# ml_model_deployment_as_an_api_using_fastapi
This repository contains the source code of the project where I trained and deployed diabetes prediction model as an api using fastapi. local-host api url was generated through running uvicorn main:app in cmd.  You can create your own local host api by using this code as it is and api will be active until the terminal is not collapsed where you runned unvicorn command. Model takes following inputs : pregnancies,glucose,blood_pressure,skin_thickness,insulin,bmi,dpf and age.

Sample input data was taken from diabetes dataset, which can be found here: https://github.com/umairsiddique3171/ML-Deployment/blob/main/ml_model_deployment_as_an_api_using_fastapi/diabetes_classifier/diabetes_data.csv

Results video was also recorded and compressed, which can be found here : https://github.com/umairsiddique3171/ML-Deployment/blob/main/ml_model_deployment_as_an_api_using_fastapi/results.mp4

# ml_model_deployment_using_streamlit
This repository contains the source code of the project where I trained and deployed diabetes prediction model. I used streamlit for deployment and web app creation. In web application interface, user has to fill following fields : pregnancies,glucose,blood_pressure,skin_thickness,insulin,bmi,dpf and age , and then push the result button to get the classification results with confidence score.
